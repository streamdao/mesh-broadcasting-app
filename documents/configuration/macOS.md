# macOS configuration guide

## Install dependencies
We recommend to install the next dependencies on macOS systems using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
brew install yarn
brew install node
brew install watchman
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdkyar
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

### React Native Cli
In a terminal run the following command.
```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

From here, the process is a bit different if we want to build for [iOS](macOS_iOS.md) or [Android](macOS_Android.md)
