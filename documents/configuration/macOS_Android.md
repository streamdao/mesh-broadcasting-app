### 3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable

We need to add the next environment variables to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc` config file:
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### 4. Run the Locha Mesh Chat application.
You can run the application in the android emulator or in your mobile phone.

#### Use your mobile phone
You can use your physical device plugging it to your computer using a USB cable and following the [next steps](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/next/running-on-device)

#### Use a virtual device
If you don't have any virtual device yet you need to create almost one following the [next steps](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html)

Now, inside the locha-mesh-chat folder we can run the application:

```bash
react-native run-android
```

That's all :wink:
